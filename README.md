# shipsheet

`shipsheet` is a thin wrapper around the `shipeeet` npm package.
All commands are forwarded directly to `shipeeet`. This is cause some people like to call it `ss` instead of `shipeeet` and this allows them to do so without having to install `shipeeet` globally.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g shipsheet
```

## Basic commands

```bash
shipsheet --help
ss --help

shipsheet <command> [options]
ss <command> [options]
```
